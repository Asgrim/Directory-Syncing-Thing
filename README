Directory Syncing Thing
=================================================
A simple script that uses inotify to "sync" files quickly when they change from one directory to another.

NOTE: This only does ONE-way synchronisation.

Released under the MIT license which is included at the top of the script.

Requirements
=================================================
Requires inotify and unison probably.

Usage
=================================================
watch_folders.sh [LOCALDIR] [REMOTEDIR] [NAME]

Uses inotify to watch [LOCALDIR] for changes and push them up to [REMOTEDIR].

e.g.
chmod +x watch_folders.sh
./watch_folders.sh /home/user/localdir /mnt/remote/remotedir whatever
