Directory Syncing Thing
=================================================
A simple script that uses inotify to "sync" files quickly when they change from one directory to another.
Note this is very early in development and was a tool just for me - if others find a use for it, it would be ace if you could contribute back! :)
Don't use on production sites etc. as it's not very tested at all.

NOTE: This only does ONE-way synchronisation.

Released under the MIT license which is included at the top of the script.

Requirements
=================================================
Requires inotify and unison probably.

Usage
=================================================
1. Copy directory-syncing-thing.conf.example to directory-syncing-thing.conf
2. Modify the config to your needs, you can "watch" as many directories as you need
3. At the moment, init.d script isn't tested so for now to start manually:

    ./directory-syncing-thing start

4. To stop

    ./directory-syncing-thing stop

5. THIS IS NOT FULLY TESTED. COMES WITHOUT WARRANTY etc. etc. DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION STUFF etc. etc.

     -= YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED =-

TODO
=================================================
* Test the init.d script to see if it actually works as an init.d script
* Do a check to see if the remote volume is mounted first
* Improve the way the config works, it's ugly and difficult to understand
