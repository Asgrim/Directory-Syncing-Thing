Directory Syncing Thing
=================================================
A simple script that uses inotify to "sync" files quickly when they change from one directory to another.
Note this is very early in development and was a tool just for me - if others find a use for it, it would be ace if you could contribute back! :)
Don't use on production sites etc. as it's not very tested at all.

NOTE: This only does ONE-way synchronisation.

Released under the MIT license which is included at the top of the script.

Requirements
=================================================
Requires inotify and unison probably.
This is currently made on Ubuntu and might/probably won't work on any other distro, I don't know really. YMMV.

Installation
=================================================
1. apt-get install inotify-tools unison-gtk
2. cd /opt
3. git clone git://github.com/Asgrim/Directory-Syncing-Thing.git directory-syncing-thing
4. chmod +x install.sh
5. sudo ./install.sh
6. EDIT THE CONFIG FILE FIRST!!!
7. /etc/init.d/directory-syncing-thing start

Usage
=================================================
1. At the moment, init.d script isn't tested so for now to start manually:

    /etc/init.d/directory-syncing-thing start

2. To stop

    /etc/init.d/directory-syncing-thing stop

3. THIS IS NOT FULLY TESTED. COMES WITHOUT WARRANTY etc. etc. DO NOT USE ON PRODUCTION STUFF etc. etc.
