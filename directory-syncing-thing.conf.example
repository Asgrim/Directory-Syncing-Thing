# The config file must have 3 BASH-format arrays
#   $WATCHDIRS_L is an array of the "local" directories (i.e the one(s) being watched)
#   $WATCHDIRS_R is an array of the "remote" directories (i.e the one(s) changes will be copied to)
#   $WATCHDIRS_N is an array of "names" or identifiers for the watches (for logs and the scripts to name them etc.)
#
# At the moment if you change the number of entries in the array WHILST the script is running
# It will probably not close everything properly so you'll be screwed.

# Previously these did not have to be declared, but now REMOTEDIR is used for waiting for remote mount point
